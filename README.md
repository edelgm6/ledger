# Ledger

Ledger is a personal accounting tool to generate the three accounting statements (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows).

## General setup

Once you've hosted Ledger, you'll need to do the following:
* Create an admin user via Django's `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Log into the Admin page to generate some accounts. At the very least, you'll need one of each `Special type`
